# Cars at a Glance
This is a tool that I used to provide a friend with car suggestions. After narrowing down types of reliable cars in her price range, I found a few Prii, and Insight, and a Camry hybrid, their details, and uploaded the table to PowerBI Desktop. Using the table, one can sort by make, model, price, and year. To choose by mileage, dots on the scatterplot can be selected. Car details are shown for one car.


Whole page with details showing first information on list

A select car and a few of its details

The categories are ones an individual would find useful. Custom information for her are distance to seller while she is asking people for rides to see cars. For recommending cars over the internet, website of listing is displayed. For a first-time car buyer, a summary of identifiers to give to the sales representatives is in a box. Safety and maintenance condition help someone assessing the quality of a used car or older model. IIHS ratings were given for these years. For price notes or bargaining, notes are in my estimate of the Kelley Blue Book condition area in the bottom left.

To compare these criteria for a number of cars, multiple tabs may be opened and switched between.

This was part of my journey learning PowerBI. From Tableau, it was easier to filter over the whole page as PowerBI filters automatically. PowerBI has more focus on manual formatting than Tableau with more centralized activity surrounding formatting. It took a while to make a URL link. PowerBI helped shepherd me to summarize on one page more than the story layout available in Tableau. The downfall to me with PowerBI is accessibility in getting an account without organizational support and to a person without a Microsoft account. Tableau Public's server is helpful in that way. It was nice to be able to create something useful to someone whether a potential car buyer or friend giving recommendations as someone with cat allergies who has already consumed allergy medication for two months straight, unsure of taking any more. If you are learning PowerBI, I hope you have a rewarding time.
